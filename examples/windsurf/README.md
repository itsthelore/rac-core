# RAC with Windsurf

[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) consumes RAC on two surfaces — a rules file
Cascade reads, and the `lore` MCP server it connects to. A stranger can reproduce
this from the file alone.

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install itsthelore/tap/rac-full   # the `decided` CLI and the `decided-mcp` server
```

A repository with a RAC corpus under `decisions/` (run `decided quickstart`, or use this
repository's own `decisions/`).

## 1. Context (the push)

```bash
decided export decisions/ --agent-rules
```

This writes `AGENTS.md` and friends — but Windsurf reads its own rules format
(`.windsurf/rules/*.md`), not `AGENTS.md`, so the durable grounding for Windsurf
comes through the `lore` MCP server in section 2. Add a short rule that points
Cascade at it — create **`.windsurf/rules/rac.md`**:

```md
# Recorded decisions (RAC)

This repository records product decisions as RAC artifacts under `decisions/`. Before
designing or changing anything a decision might cover, query the `lore` MCP tools
(`search_artifacts`, `find_decisions`, `get_related`) and follow what they return;
cite decisions by ID. Recorded decisions take precedence over conventions inferred
from the code.
```

The rule is a pointer; the substance is served live by `lore` (section 2), so it
never drifts out of date. (`decided export decisions/ --agent-rules --check` still keeps the
generated `AGENTS.md` honest for any tool that does read it.)

## 2. The `lore` MCP server (the pull)

Add the `lore` server to Windsurf's MCP config at
**`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`** (a sample is in
[`mcp_config.example.json`](mcp_config.example.json)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "asdecided": { "command": "decided-mcp", "args": ["--root", "."] }
  }
}
```

The config is global, so use an absolute `--root` path (the directory you would
pass to `decided validate`). Refresh servers in Cascade's MCP panel after saving. It
exposes the five read-only `lore` tools (`get_summary`, `search_artifacts`,
`get_artifact`, `get_related`, `find_decisions`); the server re-reads the corpus on
every call and never writes to the repo.

## 3. Enforcement is separate, and Windsurf-agnostic

RAC supplies context and enforces *after* the edit (ADR-067). There is no platform
API to veto a Windsurf agent edit before it lands, so Windsurf relies on the
post-edit guard: `decided validate` / `decided relationships --validate` and the GitHub
Action / pre-merge gate, the same as any contributor. (A pre-edit veto is
Claude-Code-specific — see [`examples/claude-code/`](../claude-code/README.md).)

## Verify it

Run the bundled grounding demo — same task twice, once unconnected and once with
`lore` connected — and watch the connected run respect a recorded decision the
unconnected run violates: [`examples/guide/`](../guide/demo.md).

## Summary

| Surface | Command | What Windsurf does with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.windsurf/rules/rac.md` | (hand-written pointer) | Reads it as an always-on rule |
| `lore` MCP | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` → `decided-mcp --root <abs>` | Calls `find_decisions` / `get_related` on demand |
| CI gate | `decided validate` · `decided relationships --validate` | Enforces on every PR |

## Verification status

- **Engine half — mechanically verified (2026-07-04).** The `decided-mcp` invocation
  this recipe prescribes was smoke-tested over stdio against `examples/guide/`: the
  five `lore` tools respond and `search_artifacts` / `get_artifact` / `get_related`
  return the grounding decision. This is the RAC-owned half every recipe shares.
- **Harness half — not yet verified.** Running the grounding demo *through Windsurf
  itself* (config parsing plus a live agent) needs the released app and an API key
  — a human/CI step. Until it is done, this recipe keeps the `verify against`
  marker below and stays out of [`docs/ecosystem.md`](../../docs/ecosystem.md).
