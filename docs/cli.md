# CLI Reference

RAC ships a single command, `rac`, with eighteen subcommands. This page documents each
one: its purpose, inputs, outputs, and exit codes.

```bash
rac <command> [arguments] [options]
rac --version
rac <command> --help
```

## Conventions

These apply across every command.

- **`--json`** — most commands accept `--json` to emit machine-readable output
  instead of the human-readable report. JSON output is a stable contract intended
  for tools, IDEs, CI, and agents.
- **Standard input** — `validate`, `inspect`, and `improve` accept `-` in place of a
  file to read Markdown from stdin (e.g. `cat file.md | rac validate -`).
- **Recursion** — directory commands (`validate`, `stats`, `inspect`,
  `relationships`, `review`, `portfolio`, `index`, `explorer`) recurse into
  subdirectories by default. Pass `--top-level`
  to scan only the immediate directory. `--recursive` is accepted explicitly for
  clarity but is already the default.
- **Exit codes** — every command follows the same convention:

  | Code | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `0` | Success |
  | `1` | Validation or relationship check failed |
  | `2` | Usage or I/O error (bad arguments, file not found, not a directory) |

---

## validate

Validate an artifact — or every artifact in a directory — for structural and
content issues.

- **Input:** `rac validate <path>` — a Markdown file, a directory, or `-` for stdin.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive` (directory mode)
- **Exit codes:** `0` no errors · `1` validation errors · `2` path not found / unreadable

```bash
rac validate login-flow.md
```

```text
PASS  login-flow.md
  warning [missing-risks] login-flow.md
          No ## Risks section (optional, but recommended).

0 error(s), 1 warning(s).
```

Warnings do not fail the run; only errors return exit `1`. Use `--json` for the
structured form (`valid`, `errors[]`, `warnings[]` with stable `code` fields).

Given a directory, `validate` classifies every `*.md` file and validates each
against its own artifact schema:

```bash
rac validate rac/
```

```text
PASS  rac/ — 66 artifact(s) checked: 66 valid, 24 skipped (unknown type).
```

Files that match no known schema are **skipped**, not failed — being a plain
document is a valid outcome (see [ADR-010](artifacts.md#documents-vs-artifacts)).
Only validation *errors* in recognized artifacts fail the run. The `--json` form
reports `summary` counts plus a per-file `files[]` list with `status`
(`valid` / `invalid` / `skipped`) and issues.

---

## diff

Compare two versions of a requirement file and report what changed.

- **Input:** `rac diff <old> <new>` — two Markdown files.
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` file not found / unreadable

```bash
rac diff examples/example_dashboard_v1.md examples/example_dashboard_v2.md
```

```text

Modified Requirements

~ REQ-002
  Before: User can filter usage charts by date range
  After:  User can filter usage charts by date range and by team
```

---

## stats

Summarize a directory of artifacts: counts, quality signals, and per-type breakdowns.

- **Input:** `rac stats <directory>` — scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` analyzable content found · `1` no valid artifacts · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac stats rac/
```

Reports feature/requirement/decision/roadmap/design counts, missing recommended
sections, and a list of files that matched no schema (not errors — see
[ADR-010](artifacts.md#documents-vs-artifacts)).

---

## ingest

Convert a document (DOCX, PDF, HTML, PPTX, XLSX, or Markdown) into RAC-compatible
Markdown.

- **Input:** `rac ingest <file>` — the source document.
- **Options:** `-o, --output <path>` (write to a file; errors if it exists unless
  `--force`) · `--stdout` (explicit stdout, the default) · `--force` · `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `1` conversion failed · `2` unsupported type / file not found / output exists without `--force`

```bash
rac ingest spec.docx                 # preview Markdown on stdout
rac ingest spec.docx -o spec.md      # write to a file
rac ingest report.pdf -o report.md --force
```

Conversion uses optional extras. Install the readers you need:
`pip install 'requirements-as-code[ingest]'` (DOCX/HTML), `[ingest-pdf]`,
`[ingest-office]` (PPTX/XLSX), or `[ingest-all]`.

---

## inspect

Identify a document's artifact type and which sections are present or missing. Works
on a single file or a whole directory.

- **Input:** `rac inspect <file|directory>` — or `-` for stdin (single file only).
- **Options:** `--json` · `--verbose` (classification breakdown and score, single
  file only) · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` (a completed inspection always succeeds — `Unknown` is a valid result)

```bash
rac inspect login-flow.md
rac inspect . --json            # aggregate type counts for a directory
```

```text
Artifact Type: Requirement
Confidence: 71%

Present Sections:
  ✓ Problem
  ✓ Requirements
  ✓ Success Metrics

Missing Sections:
  ✗ Risks
  ✗ Assumptions
```

---

## improve

Suggest the sections an artifact is missing, optionally as ready-to-paste templates.

- **Input:** `rac improve <file>` — or `-` for stdin.
- **Options:** `--json` *or* `--template` (mutually exclusive)
- **Exit codes:** `0` (suggestions are advice, not failure)

```bash
rac improve login-flow.md             # list missing sections
rac improve login-flow.md --template  # emit Markdown stubs to paste in
```

---

## schema

Show registered artifact schemas and starter templates.

- **Input:** `rac schema [name]` — `requirement`, `decision`, `roadmap`, `prompt`, or `design`.
- **Options:** `--list` (list all schema names) · `--json` *or* `--template`
  (mutually exclusive) · `--list` cannot be combined with a schema name
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` unknown schema name or flag misuse

```bash
rac schema --list                  # the five artifact types
rac schema requirement             # required / recommended / optional sections
rac schema decision --template     # starter Markdown for a decision
rac schema roadmap --json          # machine-readable schema
```

---

## relationships

Inspect — and optionally validate — explicit references between artifacts in a file
or directory.

- **Input:** `rac relationships <path>` — a directory or a single Markdown file.
- **Options:** `--validate` (resolve every reference; exit `1` on any broken,
  ambiguous, self-referencing, or duplicate-identifier finding) · `--json` ·
  `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` relationships found / all references valid · `1` validation
  issues · `2` path not found

```bash
rac relationships rac/              # list the references RAC discovered
rac relationships rac/ --validate   # check that every reference resolves
```

Finding no relationships is **not** an error. See [relationships.md](relationships.md)
for the issue codes `--validate` reports.

---

## review

Review an entire repository in one command: validate every artifact, check
every relationship, and report what needs attention — worst problems first.

- **Input:** `rac review <directory>` — scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` no blocking issues · `1` invalid artifacts or broken
  relationships found · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac review rac/
```

```text
Repository Review
=================

Directory:  rac/
Artifacts:  90

  Requirement    19
  Decision       27
  Roadmap        11
  Design         9
  Unknown        24

Validation
----------

  Valid:    66
  Invalid:  0
...
```

Findings are grouped by priority, highest impact first:

| Priority | Finding | Blocks (exit `1`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Invalid artifacts (validation errors) | yes |
| 2 | Broken relationships (unresolvable references) | yes |
| 3 | Unrecognized artifacts (no schema matched) | no — advisory |
| 4 | Missing recommended information | no — advisory |

Every finding carries a concrete suggested action (`rac validate <file>`,
`rac relationships <dir> --validate`, `rac improve <file> --template`, …), and
the report ends with the same health score `portfolio` computes. The `--json`
form is a stable contract (`schema_version: "1"`) with `ok`, `artifacts`,
`validation`, `relationships`, `health`, `issues[]`, and `actions[]`.

`review` composes the same analysis `portfolio` runs; use `portfolio` for a
one-screen summary and `review` when you want the prioritized worklist.

---

## portfolio

A one-screen repository intelligence summary: artifact counts by type, validity,
completeness, relationship coverage, an attention list, and a health score.

- **Input:** `rac portfolio <directory>` — scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac portfolio rac/
```

---

## index

Produce a flat inventory of every artifact — id, type, title, and path — so other
tools can build navigation without re-scanning files.

- **Input:** `rac index [directory]` — defaults to the current directory; scanned
  recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac index rac/
rac index rac/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "directory": "rac/requirements/",
  "recursive": true,
  "artifact_count": 4,
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "rac-documentation-structure",
      "type": "unknown",
      "title": "REQ-Documentation-Structure",
      "path": "rac/requirements/rac-documentation-structure.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## explorer

Launch the interactive terminal Explorer — browse every artifact, read it in
full, assess repository health, and reach anything through the `/` command
bar, without memorizing RAC commands. One persistent workspace frame
(v0.8.7): a navigation sidebar of type-tagged artifacts on the left, a
context panel that swaps views on the right, the always-visible `/` bar, and
a status line of key hints with the health chip — under the rac-lantern
theme by default.

Explorer is a presentation layer over the same services the CLI uses: everything
it shows is also available through `rac portfolio`, `rac index`, `rac resolve`,
`rac find`, and friends (ADR-015). It never edits artifacts (ADR-024).

- **Input:** `rac explorer [directory]` — defaults to `rac/` when present
  (ADR-018), else the current directory; scanned recursively for `*.md`.
- **Options:** `--top-level` · `--recursive` (no `--json`: the surface is interactive)
- **Keys:** `/` focuses the command bar from anywhere · `↑ ↓` navigate ·
  `Enter` select · `Tab` cycle panels · `Esc` back (bar → previous panel;
  context → view history) · `h` health · `r` reload · `q` quit. Single-letter
  shortcuts are suspended while you type in the bar.
- **Sidebar:** every artifact under "Artifacts", grouped by type with counts
  (or flat, per the `artifact_grouping` preference); rows carry a
  colour-coded type tag (`REQ` `ADR` `RMP` `PRM` `DSG`) beside the id and
  title, and the selected artifact's status chip shows in the panel border.
  The sidebar hides below 80 columns.
- **Artifact context:** opening an artifact shows four tabs — **Content**
  (the document's rendered Markdown, read-only — the default), **Inspection**
  (status, completeness, diagnostics), **Links** (relationships, impact,
  lineage; connected artifacts open on Enter, so the graph traverses one hop
  at a time and `Esc` unwinds), and **Findings** (the artifact's
  recommendations). `g` jumps to Links.
- **Commands (`/`):** `open <ref>` · `find <query> [type]` · `browse [type]` ·
  `health` · `recommendations` · `import <source> [target]` ·
  `relationships <ref>` · `resume` · `preferences` · `home` · `help` · `quit` —
  anything else is a search. Lookup resolves canonical IDs and legacy aliases
  with `rac resolve` / `rac find` semantics. Results render in the context
  panel; the layout never jumps.
- **Health:** `h` or `/health` opens the health view — Core's score with a text
  label, the Completeness / Relationships / Validation / Coverage areas, and a
  prioritized attention list whose items open the affected artifact.
- **Recommendations:** `/recommendations` (or `r` from the health view) presents
  Core's review findings grouped by category (Validation, Relationships,
  Repository Health, Quality), each with its impact, a suggested `rac` command,
  and navigation to the affected artifact. Advisory only — Explorer applies
  nothing. `x` exports them to a Markdown file (preview, then confirm).
- **Actions:** from an artifact's context view, `e` opens it in your editor
  (`$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR`; guidance shown if neither is set — Explorer never
  edits, ADR-024). `/import <source> [target]` converts a document via the
  ingest service, previews the Markdown, and writes it only after you confirm
  with `y` (never overwriting). Long conversions report progress.
- **First run:** onboarding derives from repository content (existing, empty, or
  invalid repository) and is skipped for returning users; a lantern-carrying
  mascot greets the welcome and empty states (disable with `mascot = false`).
- **Continuity & preferences:** Explorer remembers recently opened repositories
  and the last artifact per repository (under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/rac/`); `.` or
  `/resume` reopens it. Optional preferences — `theme` (default
  `rac-lantern`; any Textual theme name works), `mascot`, `animations`,
  `artifact_grouping` — live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rac/explorer.json` (no login,
  cloud, or sync); `/preferences` shows the current values and the file path.
- **Exit codes:** `0` session quit · `2` not a directory, or the `explorer` extra is
  not installed

The TUI dependency ships as an optional extra, so the core install stays light:

```bash
pip install 'requirements-as-code[explorer]'
rac explorer rac/
```

Without the extra, `rac explorer` prints the install hint above and exits `2`.

---

## new

Create a new artifact from its canonical bundled template, with a
system-assigned opaque ID written as YAML frontmatter. The generated file uses
the same structure the validators expect: edit the `TODO` placeholders and it
passes `rac validate`.

- **Input:** `rac new <type> <output-path>` — type is `requirement`,
  `decision`, `roadmap`, `prompt`, or `design`; the output path is taken
  literally (no filename derivation, no extension magic).
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` created · `1` packaged template missing or malformed
  repository config · `2` unsupported type, output file already exists, output
  directory missing, or repository not initialized (run `rac init` first)

`rac new` never overwrites an existing file and never creates directories. The
repository key comes from the nearest `.rac/config.yaml` (see [`init`](#init));
the assigned ID is permanent — it survives renames, moves, and type changes.

```bash
rac init
rac new requirement rac/requirements/user-authentication.md
rac new decision rac/decisions/adr-029-example.md --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "created": true,
  "type": "decision",
  "path": "rac/decisions/adr-029-example.md",
  "id": "RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7"
}
```

A generated artifact begins with the canonical metadata envelope:

```markdown
---
schema_version: 1
id: RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7
type: decision
---
# Title
...
```

---

## templates

List the canonical artifact templates available to `rac new`. The set is the
artifact spec registry itself — the same source that drives classification and
validation.

- **Input:** `rac templates`
- **Options:** `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` success

```bash
rac templates
rac templates --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "templates": ["requirement", "decision", "roadmap", "prompt", "design"]
}
```


---

## init

Establish the repository identity namespace: a `.rac/config.yaml` holding the
`repository_key` that prefixes every ID assigned by `rac new`. The key is
configuration, not artifact meaning — it never dictates folder structure.

- **Input:** `rac init [directory]` — defaults to the current directory.
- **Options:** `--key KEY` (default `RAC`; 2–10 uppercase alphanumeric
  characters starting with a letter) · `--json`
- **Exit codes:** `0` initialized, or already initialized with the same key
  (idempotent) · `1` a different key is already established (never silently
  rewritten) · `2` invalid key or not a directory

```bash
rac init
rac init --key PROJ
rac init docs/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "repository_key": "PROJ",
  "config_path": ".rac/config.yaml",
  "created": true
}
```


---

## resolve

Resolve an artifact ID to its type, title, and path. Matching is
case-insensitive and covers canonical IDs and legacy aliases (`## ID` values,
filename prefixes, stems), so lookups survive renames, moves, and identity
migration.

- **Input:** `rac resolve <ID> [directory]` — directory defaults to the
  current directory.
- **Options:** `--json` · `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` resolved · `1` not found, or duplicate ID (paths listed
  on stderr; never silently resolved by path order) · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac resolve RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7 rac/
rac resolve adr-015 rac/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "id": "RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7",
  "type": "decision",
  "title": "Markdown Is the Canonical Source Format",
  "path": "rac/decisions/markdown-first.md"
}
```

---

## find

Search artifacts by ID, title, filename, or path — a deterministic,
case-insensitive substring match (no ranking heuristics). Results are ordered
by match field (ID, then title, then filename/path) with sorted path as the
tiebreak. An empty result is a valid outcome, not an error.

- **Input:** `rac find <query> [directory]` — directory defaults to the
  current directory.
- **Options:** `--type TYPE` (only match one artifact type) · `--json` ·
  `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` search completed (matches or none) · `2` not a directory

```bash
rac find markdown rac/
rac find explorer rac/ --type decision
rac find "canonical format" rac/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "query": "markdown",
  "type": null,
  "match_count": 1,
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": "RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7",
      "type": "decision",
      "title": "Markdown Is the Canonical Source Format",
      "path": "rac/decisions/markdown-first.md"
    }
  ]
}
```


---

## migrate

Bring existing artifacts onto canonical frontmatter identity. Every
recognized artifact without a frontmatter block gains the canonical envelope
(`schema_version`, a system-assigned ID, its classified `type`); the Markdown
body is preserved byte-for-byte. Idempotent — re-running changes nothing, and
a document repaired to classify is picked up by the next run.

- **Input:** `rac migrate metadata <directory>` — requires an initialized
  repository (`rac init`).
- **Options:** `--dry-run` (report without writing) · `--json` ·
  `--top-level` · `--recursive`
- **Exit codes:** `0` completed, including nothing to migrate · `1`
  malformed repository config or ID generation failure · `2` not a
  directory, or repository not initialized

Artifacts that already carry frontmatter — valid or broken — are never
touched; documents that do not classify are listed, never guessed at.

```bash
rac migrate metadata rac/ --dry-run   # preview
rac migrate metadata rac/             # migrate
rac migrate metadata rac/ --json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "directory": "rac/",
  "recursive": true,
  "dry_run": false,
  "summary": {
    "total_files": 95,
    "migrated": 28,
    "already_canonical": 67,
    "skipped_unknown": 0
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "rac/decisions/adr-001-markdown-first.md",
      "status": "migrated",
      "id": "RAC-01JY4M8X2QZ7",
      "type": "decision"
    }
  ]
}
```
