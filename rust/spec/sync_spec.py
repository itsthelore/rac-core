"""Cross-repo sync gate for the shared artifact-spec registry (ADR-063 Guard 1).

The registry's source of truth is the upstream `itsthelore/rac-spec`
(`schema/artifact-specs.json`); rac-core vendors it into
`rust/rac-engine/assets/spec/artifact-specs.json`, which the native engine embeds.
This gate proves the vendored copy has not drifted from the upstream: it
compares the `artifact_specs` and `relationship_descriptions` payloads (the keys
the engines consume) byte-for-parsed-value. The `_meta` block is provenance and
differs by design between the upstream (source) and the vendored (copy) roles,
so it is not compared.

The upstream location is given by the DECIDED_SPEC_DIR environment variable (a path
to a rac-spec checkout). When it is unset, the gate skips with exit 0 — until
rac-spec is wired into CI there is nothing to compare against, and the in-repo
native contract tests still prove the embedded registry is valid.

Usage:
    DECIDED_SPEC_DIR=/path/to/rac-spec python rust/spec/sync_spec.py
Exit 0 = in sync (or skipped); 1 = drift; 2 = setup error.
